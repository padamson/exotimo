exotimo
=======

Molecular orbital calculations including exotic particles such as positrons and muons. Emphasis will be on the following: 

1. computational approaches that will provide reasonable results for large molecular or solid state systems containing one or more exotic particles
2. methods for computing experimental observables such as positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy and Doppler broadening of annihilation radiation
