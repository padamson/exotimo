ExotiMO is a software package that is intended for \textit{ab initio} molecular quantum chemistry
studies, and is suited for modeling of systems of arbitrary numbers and types of 
classical (e.g. nucleonic) and quantum (e.g. electronic, muonic) particles. 
This specification is relevant to version 1.0 of the package. Future versions
will have additional features.

Briefly, ExotiMO can compute self-consistent field (SCF) wavefunctions at the Restricted Hartree-Fock (RHF)
level. Second-order M\{o}ller-Plesset (MP2) correlation corrections to RHF wavefunctions is available. 
Gradients of classical particle and basis function center positions are available for automatic geometry optimization.  

Many basis sets are stored internally.

Computations are performed using direct techniques. Although not the primary focus of this version, 
the package is written in the Chapel programming language, and it is meant to be massively parallel 
"from the ground up." 

For sytems containing electrons and one positron, the two-photon annihilation rate and the two-photon momentum density (TPMD)
are availble as wavefunction properties.
