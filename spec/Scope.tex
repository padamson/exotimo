ExotiMO is a new quantum chemistry package that is intended
for modeling of systems of arbitrary numbers and types of 
classical and quantum particles.

This document is ultimately intended to be the definitive
specification of the ExotiMO package.  The current draft is a
work-in-progress and therefore incomplete.
