ExotiMO is a new quantum chemistry package that is intended
for modeling of systems of arbitrary numbers and types of 
classical and quantum particles.
This document is structured in such a way that it will serve several purposes.
It is both a "good"\cite{spolsky-spec} functional (\ie requirements) 
specification \textit{and} a technical specification of Version 1.0 of the ExotiMO package.  
Additionally, it \textit{is} the actual ExotiMO package code and associated test suite.

\begin{TODO}
Describe the hybrid BDD and Literate Programming approach and tools used to execute it.
\end{TODO}

\begin{TODO}
Describe the inspiration behind this approach to developing ExotiMO (Cook, Handbook of Computational Quantum 
Chemistry \cite{cook}) and BDD approaches common in web programming.  
Write this after the basic architecture and approach to documentation and testing (Makefile.devel spectests) 
is determined.
\end{TODO}

This specification will be updated for future versions of ExotiMO.

The current draft is a work-in-progress and therefore incomplete.
