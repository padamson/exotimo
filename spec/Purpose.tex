ExotiMO is a new quantum chemistry package that is intended
for modeling of systems of arbitrary numbers and types of 
classical and quantum particles, and 
this document is intended to be both a "good"\cite{spolsky-spec} functional (\ie requirements) 
specification and a technical specification of Version 1.0 of the ExotiMO package.  
This specification will be updated for future versions of ExotiMO.

The current draft is a work-in-progress and therefore incomplete.
