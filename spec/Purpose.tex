ExotiMO is a new quantum chemistry package that is intended
for modeling of systems of arbitrary numbers and types of 
classical and quantum particles, and 
this document is intended to be the definitive
requirements and technical specification of Version 1.0 of the ExotiMO package.  
This specification will be updated for future versions of ExotiMO.

The current draft is a
work-in-progress and therefore incomplete.
