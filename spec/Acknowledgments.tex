Hopefully the list of contributors to the ExotiMO package and
its specification will grow long in
the future. For now, it's just me, Paul Adamson.

Chapel is a derivative of a number of quantum chemistry codes
and takes ideas directly from them, especially GAMESS, pyQuante,
and NWChem.

The structure and approach of this specification draws heavily from that of the 
language in which it is written, Chapel. Much thanks to the Chapel team
for making the source code for the Chapel specification available.
