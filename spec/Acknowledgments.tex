Hopefully the list of contributors to the ExotiMO package and
this specification will grow long in
the future. The package is a derivative of a number of quantum chemistry codes
and takes ideas directly from them. Of particular note are pyQuante,\cite{pyquante} 
GAMESS,\cite{gamess19may2004} and the \lstinline{WEB} in the excellent handbook by 
Cook.\cite{cook}

\begin{TODO}
Add brief description of literate programming through WEBs in a footnote or something.
\end{TODO}

The structure and approach of this specification draws heavily from that of the 
language in which it is written, Chapel.\cite{chapel-specification} Much thanks to the Chapel team
for making the source code for the Chapel specification and various development scripts 
available as part of the Git repository for Chapel.\cite{chapel-repository}
